     This section showcases the performance of various machine learning models trained to predict the likelihood of heart disease. The models are evaluated based on metrics like *Accuracy, **Precision, **Recall, and **F1-Score*. Below, we explain each evaluation parameter and how it relates to model performance. 📈

    ### Evaluating Parameters:
    To assess the quality of a model, we use the following metrics:

    1. *Accuracy*: The proportion of correct predictions made by the model out of all predictions. 
        - A higher accuracy means the model is making more correct predictions overall.
    2. *Precision*: The proportion of true positive predictions (correctly predicted heart attack cases) out of all positive predictions made by the model.
        - Higher precision means the model is good at predicting positive cases and not making too many false positives.
    3. *Recall*: The proportion of true positive predictions (correct heart attack cases) out of all actual positive cases in the dataset.
        - A higher recall means the model is good at identifying heart attack cases and not missing too many.
    4. *F1-Score*: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, offering a balance between the two.
        - A higher F1-Score indicates that both precision and recall are high, meaning the model is both accurate and reliable.

    ### Confusion Matrix for Random Forest and Decision Tree:
    We also evaluate models using the *Confusion Matrix*, which helps understand the breakdown of predictions into:
    - *True Positives (TP)*: Correct predictions of a heart attack.
    - *True Negatives (TN)*: Correct predictions of no heart attack.
    - *False Positives (FP)*: Incorrect predictions of a heart attack when there is none.
    - *False Negatives (FN)*: Incorrect predictions of no heart attack when there is one.
    
    The confusion matrix shows how well the model distinguishes between the two classes (heart attack vs. no heart attack).

    ### Performance Metrics of Random Forest:
    *Accuracy*: 83.70%  
    Random Forest's confusion matrix shows that:
    
    - For *Class 0 (No Heart Attack)*, the model has a precision of 0.79 and a recall of 0.79, indicating a reasonable balance between predicting no heart attack and avoiding false positives.
    - For *Class 1 (Heart Attack)*, the precision and recall are both higher at 0.87, meaning the model is quite effective at identifying actual heart attack cases.
    
    Overall, the Random Forest model performs well with a *macro average* of 0.83 for precision, recall, and F1-score, and a *weighted average* of 0.84, showing good overall performance across both classes.

    ### Performance Metrics of Decision Tree:
    *Accuracy*: 83.70%  
    Decision Tree’s confusion matrix shows:
    
    - For *Class 0 (No Heart Attack)*, the precision is 0.88, but recall drops to 0.67, meaning that the model is good at predicting no heart attack but misses some cases.
    - For *Class 1 (Heart Attack)*, the precision is 0.82 and recall is 0.94, indicating that the model is very effective at identifying true heart attack cases, but may sometimes misclassify a few no-heart-attack cases as heart attack cases.

    The Decision Tree model's *macro average* is 0.81 for recall and 0.82 for F1-score, with a *weighted average* of 0.84, suggesting it performs well but with a slight bias towards predicting heart attacks.

    ### Performance Comparison of All Models:
    Below is the comparison of the performance of all the models used in this study:

    | Model                        | Accuracy (%) | Precision | Recall | F1 Score |
    |------------------------------|--------------|-----------|--------|----------|
    | Logistic Regression           | 82.22        | 0.82      | 0.82   | 0.82     |
    | Naive Bayes                   | 78.52        | 0.79      | 0.79   | 0.79     |
    | *Random Forest*             | *83.70*    | *0.84*  | *0.84* | *0.84* |
    | Extreme Gradient Boost        | 61.48        | 0.38      | 0.61   | 0.47     |
    | K-Nearest Neighbour           | 82.22        | 0.82      | 0.82   | 0.82     |
    | *Decision Tree*             | *83.70*    | *0.84*  | *0.84* | *0.83* |
    | Support Vector Machine        | 83.70        | 0.84      | 0.84   | 0.83     |

    ### Insights:
    - The *Random Forest, **Decision Tree, and **Support Vector Machine* models achieved the highest *accuracy (83.70%)*. This shows their strong ability to predict heart attack risk.
    - *Random Forest* stands out with a balanced performance across precision, recall, and F1-Score, making it a reliable model for heart attack prediction.
    - While *Extreme Gradient Boost* has a much lower accuracy (61.48%) and precision (0.38), it struggles with predicting heart attack cases accurately and is not ideal for this task.
    - *Logistic Regression* and *K-Nearest Neighbour* perform similarly to Random Forest, but slightly less accurate and precise.

    ### Conclusion:
    The *Random Forest* and *Decision Tree* models both perform exceptionally well and are our top picks for predicting heart attack risk. They balance accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-Score, providing a reliable prediction system for heart disease risk assessment. 🔍💓

    We encourage users to use these predictions and visualizations to make informed decisions about their health. With further improvements in data collection and model training, we aim to increase the accuracy of these models for better, more personalized health predictions in the future.

    - Chest Pain or Discomfort: Often described as pressure or squeezing sensation.

    - Shortness of Breath: May occur with or without chest discomfort.

    - Pain or Discomfort in Other Areas: Such as arms (especially left arm), shoulder blades,
      neck jaw back stomach.

    - Nausea/Vomiting: Some individuals may experience stomach upset along with other symptoms.

    - Lightheadedness/Fainting: Feeling dizzy or faint can also indicate an issue related to heart health.

    If you experience any of these symptoms especially if they last more than few minutes seek immediate medical attention!
